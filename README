Crap is a new programmimg language, written by Malex
for exercise.
Its main features are to be highly modulable,
easy pluggable, to give a simple access to low level
controls (such as pointer and memory allocation) remaining 
a high level language though.
It is completely object-oriented, but you are free to 
use other programming paradigm.
Its syntax is created on-the-fly, while writing the parser
or the doc.
